 <h4>CSS</h4>
 <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, 
   colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility
    and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate 
    .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be 
    cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

   <h4>REACT</h4>
   <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end 
     JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained 
     by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies
      React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, 
      or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, 
      React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM,
       so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing,
        as well as certain client-side functionality.</p>
